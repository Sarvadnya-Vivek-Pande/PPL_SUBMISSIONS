1.The original code showed two computations, but the FRE pass was able to  reuse the  temporary variable  which  stored the  result of  the
  intitial computation  of (a +  c). Thus,  one line of  execution wassaved, and so was the use of an extra variable.

2.Check  the   file  B-4.c.*.optimized.   This  is  the   last  GIMPLEintra-procedural pass. If  it is same as the output  of FRE, then no
  more optimizations have occured.

3."return  b" was  required to  make the  computation of  variable `b' meaningful. If function  `main' is going to "return 0"  and there is
  no other  output, GCC  will realise that  the entire  computation of variable `b' was  dead code and will eliminate  its dependencies one
  by one until the resulting program reduces to:
        int main()
        {
         return 0;
        }
